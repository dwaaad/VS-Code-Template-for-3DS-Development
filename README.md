# VS Code Template for devkitPro 3DS Development 
Premade Visual Studio Code configuration files to aid in devkitPro 3DS development.

It will solve devkitPro libraries not picking up, and either automatically build and emulate, or automatically build and run on hardware.

## Setup
> [!NOTE]
> This assumes you have already setup devkitPro for Windows OS. A small guide I'd like to recommend is this [Nintendo 3DS Homebrewing - Getting Started Guide By Drake Rochelle](https://gbatemp.net/threads/3ds-homebrew-development-getting-started-guide.666095/)


### Library Detection
Libraries should be recognised without any need to setup. However, if VS Code still doesn't recognise the libraries, you can edit the [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) `settings.json` to include:
```json
{
    "C_Cpp.default.includePath": [
        "${workspaceFolder}\\**",
        "C:\\devkitPro\\**",
        "C:\\devkitPro\\libctru\\include\\**",
        "C:\\devkitPro\\devkitARM\\include\\**",
        "C:\\devkitPro\\devkitARM\\arm-none-eabi\\include\\**",
        "C:\\devkitPro\\devkitARM\\lib\\gcc\\arm-none-eabi\\**",
        "C:\\devkitPro\\portlibs\\3ds\\include\\**"
    ],
}
```

### Emulation
The emulation launch task will prompt VS Code to automatically build *(using "make")* and run the resulting `.3dsx` file in a 3DS emulator, which you have to link yourself in the [`launch.json`](https://github.com/dwaaad/VS-Code-Template-for-3DS-Development/blob/main/template/.vscode/launch.json) file.
Put your path to `.exe` there and you should be good to go!

### 3DS Link
There is another configuration that I have recently added which will make testing on real hardware much faster as well. This will automate the use of the 3dslink tool which comes bundled with devkitPro's 3ds-dev environment.

In order to get this working I highly suggest you make the tool a system wide path variable so that it may be used from any location on the terminal.

If you don't want to do this for some reason, you'll have to edit the "3dslink" in the launch.json to "C:\devkitPro\tools\bin\3dslink.exe".

Let's break it down:
1. First add `3dstool.exe` as an environment variable. I did this as in my User Path. The fastest way to get there is to press <kbd>ðŸªŸ Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> on your keyboard and paste `SystemPropertiesAdvanced`
3. Then press the <kbd>Environment Variables</kbd> button
4. A new window will pop up. Under "User variables for...", double click on the "Path" variable
5. Another window should open with a list of user path variables, double click on the blank space under the list and paste C:\devkitPro\tools\bin to add it to your Path
6. Press OK on all aforementioned windows
7. You can check you've done it correctly by typing in any cmd "3dslink" and hitting enter. It should output the version number with the help commands

Now that we can actually use the tool, we must edit the launch.json to include our own 3DSs IP Address.
1. You can get this by opening the homebrew menu app on your modded 3DS and pressing <kbd>Y</kbd>. You must do this everytime you would like to run on hardware.
2. Go to the launch.json and replace `3ds.ip.address.123` with your actual IP
3. Save file changes and smile because we're done :)

Now when we try run the project we can safely choose the option "3dslink: Build & Run on Hardware".
