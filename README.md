# VS Code Template for 3DS Development devkitPro Setup
Premade VS Code configuration files to aid in devkitPro 3DS development, that automatically build (using "make") and run in a 3DS emulator that you can pass in the [launch.json](https://github.com/dwaaad/VS-Code-Template-for-3DS-Development/blob/main/template/.vscode/launch.json) file.
If you've been struggling with setting up VS Code with devkitPro, such as devkitPro libraries not picking up etc, this should solve all your issues assuming you installed devkitPro with the official Windows [installer](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases/latest).
